Step 2: Cleaning the data

Step 3: Exploratory data analysis
- Find summary statistics
- Find the data types
- Bar plot of top 10 producers considering ingredients used
- Scatter plot of changes in the ratings of the chocolate bars
- Violin plot of the distribution of ratings

Step 4: Questions
- See if ratings have changed over time for a particular chocolate (if rows are available)
- Multiple regression
- Hypothesis testing
- 15 top tastes of chocolates
- ???
